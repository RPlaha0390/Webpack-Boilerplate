# Webpack-Boilerplate

This Webpack Boilerplate is designed to watch, clean and copy image files over to your dist folder without running a dev server.
If you wish to run a dev server then look at ```webpack dev server```.

## Getting Started

To get started clone the repository on to your local machine. ```https://github.com/RPlaha0390/Webpack-Boilerplate.git```

## Prerequisites

To use this respository you must have ```node``` installed. If not then download it from here ```https://nodejs.org```

### Installing 

Please following the following steps to complete installation:

1. Open up your Terminal/Command Prompt window
2. CD into the Webpack Boilerplate repository
3. Run `npm install`. This will create a ```node modules``` folder, and install all the packages we need.
4. To run webpack, go to the CLI and type `npm run build`.
5. Now change a scss file in the ```src/scss``` directory and notice how the ```dist/style.css``` has changed.
